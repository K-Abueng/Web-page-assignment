<h4>History</h4>
<p>The city of Budapest was officially created on 17 November 1873 from a merger of the three neighboring cities of Pest, Buda and Óbuda. Smaller towns on the outskirts of the original city were amalgamated into Greater Budapest in 1950. The origins of Budapest can be traced to Celts who occupied the plains of Hungary in the 4th century BC. The area was later conquered by the Roman Empire, which established the fortress and town of Aquincum on the site of today's Budapest around AD 100. The Romans were expelled in the 5th century by the Huns, who were challenged by various tribes during the next several centuries. The Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin started at the end of the 9th century, and the Kingdom of Hungary was established at the end of the 11th century.</p><br>

<p>From around 1300 to the incorporation of 1873, Buda was the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary for five periods of less than a century each.
Traces of the first settlements in the area of the city of Budapest today date back to the Stone Age, but many nations alternated throughout history in longer or shorter periods. However, known history of Budapest begins with the Roman town of Aquincum, founded around 89 AD on the site of an old Celtic settlement, near Obuda. Aquincum was the capital of the province of lower Pannonia from 106 AD until the end of the 4th century. Contra Aquincum (or Trans Aquincum) was in place of today’s Pest. Under the leadership of the famous Attila, Huns advanced in the Pannonian Plain in the 5th century.</p><br>

<p>In 1896 Ugrians, today’s Hungarians, led by Arpad from the area of ​​the Lower Dnieper and the Danube, crossed the Carpathians and settled in the area of today’s Pannonia between the Danube and the Tisa and established the state. These skilled horsemen reached Central Europe, where they were stopped by Otto I the Great, at the Battle of Lehfeld, near present-day Augsburg, in 955 AD. Very soon, during the reign of Saint Stephen, Hungarians accepted Christianity in 1001, while receiving the crown from the Pope. Hungary was ruled Arpads from 1001 until 1301 when rulers came from foreign dynasties. In 1241, at the time of King Bela IV, who was considered the second founder of Hungary, the Tatars devastated Pannonian area, so the king Bela started fortification and construction of the king’s palace in Buda.</p>

Since its founding until the Battle of Mohács, the Hungarian state was very influential in the Balkan and European area. With the advent of the Turks and their invasions in the north, Hungary came under direct strikes. Already in 1521 the Turks conquered Hungarian Belgrade in Mohács battle, in 1526, the Turks again were victorious on that occasion killed the king Lajos II Jagiellon, Hungary will cease to exist as an independent state. After the battle of Mohács part of Hungary fell under Ottoman Empire, other became part of the Habsburg Empire, and the third became semi-independent state under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. Turkish pasha was based in Buda until 1686.</p><br>

<p>At the end of the seventeenth and early eighteenth century, the Habsburgs invaded Transylvania and Ottoman territories in the Pannonia, so all Hungarians came under the rule Habsburg. Events in Europe in 1848 did not miss Hungary. Under the leadership of Lajos Kossuth and Lajos Batthyány they raised rebellion against the Habsburgs, demanding national rights. However, what the Hungarians sought from the Habsburgs, they did not give to non-Hungarian population, which was one of the reasons why the other sided with the Habsburgs. The revolution was brutally suppressed, but after 1860, Habsburg policy changed towards Hungarians. In 1867 the Habsburg monarchy was transformed into the Austro – Hungarian Empire and Hungary was given a large degree of autonomy. In the booming economic development after the revolution and the creation of the dual monarchy, Buda and Pest were being developed into European capital. Independent cities Pest, Buda and Obuda were merged into one city called Budapest in 1873.</p>

In the First World War (1914 – 1918), the Austro Hungarian Empire, along with Germany, Bulgaria and Turkey was a member of the defeated Central Powers. After the war and the collapse of the Austro Hungarian Empire, Hungary became an independent state. In the postwar period Trianon agreement defined the boundaries of the new state; Hungary remained without two-thirds of its territory. After a brief life of the Hungarian Soviet Republic under the leadership of Bela Kun, the Hungarian monarchy was restored but before the determination of the crowns successor, the role of regent was performed by Miklos Horthy.</p><br>

<p>By the end of World War II from 1945 to 1989, Hungary was part of the Soviet sphere of influence and the Warsaw Pact. Anti communist and anti-Soviet rebellion occurred in 1956. The revolt was brutally suppressed, and the then Prime Minister Imre Nagy was sentenced to death. Major changes in the political life of Hungary occurred at the end of 1989, greater freedom in organizing and political action, agreement on the withdrawal of the Soviet army was signed and the state changed its name to Republic of Hungary. Communists lost the power and Hungary became a member of NATO and the European Union.</p><br>

Szent Istvan Basilica in Budapest
One of the most interesting facts about Budapest is that no building in the city can be taller than 96 meters. The number 96 represents the year when the Magyars settled in the area (896). The fact that Szent Istvan Basilica and the Hungarian Parliament are the same height is not coincidental, but rather symbolic for the equal importance of religion and government in Hungary. </p><br>

If you ever visited a synagogue you probably noticed they are generally quite simple and austere places of worship. But not the Great Synagogue in Budapest.

<p>Budapest has a secret subterranean world<br>
Beneath the city of Budapest lies a hidden subterranean world, a maze of over 200 caverns. The caverns are the result of the large number of geothermal springs in the area. Many of these caves are open to the public for guided spelunking adventures.

The most interesting one of the is the underground labyrinth located right beneath the Castle Hill, in Budapest Old Town. The 6-mile long Budavari Labirintus has a very tumultuous history.

The underground labyrinth served as a shelter for prehistoric people, a cellar and a prison in medieval times, a military hospital during World War II, and a command post during the Cold War.

In more recent times, the Labirintus became a museum that displays Budapest’s rich history. 

In 2011 the police raided the Labyrinth and subsequently closed it (for undisclosed reasons.) After it reopened, only a part of it was accessible for visitation. We were lucky enough to visit the entire Budavari Labirintus in 2004 (we too the photos above were taken during that visit).</p><br>

<p> Budapest has a train run by children<br>
Did you know that Budapest has a train that is run almost entirely by children? Not many visitors to Budapest know about this interesting fact. The Children’s Railway was started after World War II as a training ground for communist kids after a model introduced in the former Soviet Union in the 1940’s. 


 
Children between the ages of 10 and 14 can complete a four-month training course to become train conductors, workers and inspectors, on this 11 km railway. Except for the station master and the train drivers who are adults, all the other jobs are performed by children.

children workers on the train are an interesting thing about Budapest 
The Children’s Railway in Budapest is run almost entirely by children
It’s impressive to see how seriously these children take their role. The ride is about 45 minutes long and takes you to the top of the Buda Hills. There are some beautiful spots where you can stop to admire the scenery. Buying a day ticket gives you the option to hop off and hop back on at one of nine alpine-looking stations.</p><br>

<p> There is a cave church in Budapest<br>
Few of the visitors of Budapest know of the little church in the rock under the Gellert Hill, in Budapest Old Town. Truth is that Sziklatemplom (‘Rock Church’) enjoys very little fame, being surrounded by so many grandiose churches. If you happen to be at the Liberty Bridge (the green metal one), you can take a look at this strange chapel founded by a group of Pauline monks in 1926.</p><br>
