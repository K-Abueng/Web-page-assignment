<h1>Tourist attractions in Budapest</h1>
<h4>1.Buda Castle & Castle Hill</h4>

<p>Towering over the Danube, Budapest's Castle Hill (Várhegy) contains many of the city's most important medieval monuments and museums. Topping the list of these impressive structures is the 18th-century Buda Castle (Budavári Palota), a massive 200-room palace that replaced a 13th-century castle built to protect the stronghold from Mongol and Tartar attacks.</p>

<p>Although badly damaged in World War II, much of the exterior has been restored, along with sections of the interior, which now houses a number of important museums. These include the Hungarian National Gallery in the main wing, while in the south wing, the Budapest History Museum occupies four floors.</p>

<p>In front of the castle, overlooking the Danube, stands a bronze equestrian statue of Prince Eugene of Savoy, a hero of Turkish attacks on the city. Castle Hill is worth exploring for its medieval lanes and it Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque architecture. This entire historic complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Like much of the city, Buda Castle is spectacularly illuminated at night, and the castle courtyards remain open 24 hours a day. You can reach the castle on the restored historic Castle Funicular Railway, which departs from the Buda end of the Chain Bridge.</p>



<h4>2.The Danube Promenade</h4>

<p>The Danube (or "Duna" in Hungarian) flows through Budapest from north to south, and in some places within city boundaries is as much as 640 meters wide. One of the top free things to do in Budapest is strolling along the Danube Promenade (Dunakorzó), a pleasant century-old riverside walk that extends between the Elisabeth and Széchenyi Chain Bridges.</p>

<p>Although there are many places from which to enjoy views of the majestic river as you stroll its banks (either the Buda or Pest sides, they're both good), the Danube Promenade is definitely one of the best vantage points to take in views of the city's stunning architecture.

It's also on the banks of the Danube (the northeast side, close to the Hungarian Parliament buildings) that you'll find the chilling Shoes on the Danube Bank memorial, a series of 60 pairs of steel sculpted shoes commemorating Jews shot here by the Nazis. It's a poignant and moving reminder of the Nazi atrocities suffered by Hungary in World War II.</p>

<p>Another great way to view the city is via a boat cruise along the Danube. Numerous tourist excursions depart regularly from the landing stages at Vigadó tér on the Pest bank and Bem József tér on the Buda bank, and are highly recommended. It's also fun watching these sturdy vessels from the historic Freedom Bridge as they whip down river only to have to struggle back against the curren</p>

<h4>3.Budapest Zoo & Botanical Garden</h4>

<p>Said to be one of the world's oldest still-operating zoos, Budapest Zoo & Botanical Garden (Fovárosi Állat- és Növénykert) is one of the top things for families to do when visiting the city. Established over 150 years ago, the park is home to over 1,070 different species of animals, and has the rare distinction of being located in the heart of its host city.</p>

<p>In addition to its well-preserved Art Nouveau animal homes, this top-notch zoo park features a nature reserve, themed animal enclosures, and a variety of kid-friendly programming including feeding opportunities. If you're not in a big hurry to leave, hang around for one of the regular evening concerts.</p>

<p>Leading the list of other fun things to do for families in Budapest is paying a visit to the incredibly fun Miniversum Budapest. Though basically a massive model railway setup, this relatively new family attraction features detailed models of major Hungarian landmarks, along with a sprinkling from other European countries, including Germany and Austria. These are all connected by numerous model trains (up to 100 are running at any given time), 1,300 meters of track, and authentic-looking scenery, all made to scale. Fun behind-the-scenes tours are also available</p>
